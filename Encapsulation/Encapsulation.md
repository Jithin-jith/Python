# Encapsulation in Python

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** that involves **hiding** the internal details of an object and providing controlled access to its data. It helps in data protection and enforces **data integrity**.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use Encapsulation?
- **Data Hiding**: Prevents direct modification of object attributes.
- **Controlled Access**: Uses getter and setter methods for validation.
- **Encapsulated Logic**: Allows computed properties and lazy evaluations.
